First steps
===========


Starting a GRASS session requires basic knowledge about software
itself. GRASS motivates to organize user's data from early
beginning. GRASS is using consistently structure of so-called
**locations** and **mapsets** to organize its data. This hasn't been
changed in GRASS 8.

.. _location-mapset-section:

GRASS data structure has three levels:

#. **Database directory.** A directory on local or network disc which
   contains all data accessed by GRASS. It's usually directory called
   :file:`grassdata` located in a user's home directory. 

#. **Location**. All geodata stored within one location must have the
   same spatial coordinate system (GRASS doesn't support on-the-fly
   projection from several reasons).

#. **Mapset** Contains task-related data within one project. Helps
   organizing data into logical groups or to separate parallel work of
   more users on the same project.

.. note:: In GRASS 7 before entering a session a startup screen
   (:numref:`startup7`) appeared, the user had to define working
   environment in which GRASS session has been started. This step has
   been required to enter GRASS. Such approach is not so
   common. Applications like Esri ArcGIS or QGIS just starts. The user
   loads different data from various data sources in different
   projections, and starts working on his/her project.

   .. _startup7:
   
   .. figure:: ../images/units/02/startup-0.png

      GRASS GIS startup screen in version 7.

   
Obstacles (especially for newcomers) related to the startup screen has
been reduced in presented version GRASS 8. The startup screen has been
replaced by a completely new mechanism. GRASS 8 on the first launch
sets up *database directory* automatically and launches GUI in a
default location *World LatLong WGS84*. Also a sample *world* vector
layer (in GRASS terminology *vector map*) is shown.

GRASS GUI is designed as a *simple and lightweight* graphical user
interface. Basically it is a GUI front-end calling GRASS commands (see
:ref:`grass-modules`) in the background. The GUI consists of two main
windows, see :numref:`startup8`.

.. _startup8:

.. figure:: ../images/units/02/grass8-start.png
   :class: large
           
   GRASS GIS 8 on startup.

.. tip:: If GUI crashes, it can be started again by :grasscmd:`g.gui`
   command from underlaying terminal (command prompt).
         
GRASS GUI navigates a user by tooltips as shown in
:numref:`startup8`. Default location is not designed for a real
work. The next step is usually to create own "project" (in GRASS
terminology *a location*) by user-defined spatial coordinate system.

.. _create-location:

Create a new location
---------------------

By clicking on :item:`Create new Location` button in tooltip (or by
|grass-location-add| from the toolbar) the wizard appears. A new GRASS
location can be easily created by :wikipedia:`EPSG` code or
user-defined geodata.

In the first page of a wizard, a location name is defined, optionally
also short description can be added.
          
.. figure:: ../images/units/02/create-location-0.png

   Define a name for new GRASS location. 

In the next page a coordinate reference system (CRS) is chosen. CRS is
usually defined by EPSG code (:item:`Select CRS from a list by EPSG or
description`) or by user-defined geodata (:item:`Read CRS from a
georeferenced data file`). 

.. figure:: ../images/units/02/create-location-1.png

   Choose CRS for creating a new GRASS location.

In our case a new location will be created by defining :epsg:`3035`.

.. figure:: ../images/units/02/create-location-2.png

   Define CRS by EPSG code.

.. figure:: ../images/units/02/create-location-3.png

   After defining EPSG code also datum transformation parameters must
   be defined.

A new GRASS user-defined location will be created by clicking on
:item:`Finish` button.

.. figure:: ../images/units/02/create-location-4.png

   Check the summary.

By default GRASS creates in the new location a *PERMANENT mapset*
where location settings is stored. This mapset is usually used for
importing input geodata used in the location.

.. figure:: ../images/units/02/create-location-5.png

   GRASS GUI is automatically switched to the new location.
